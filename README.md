## üìñProject Description

> This project involves writing a miniature relational database management system (DBMS) that stores tables of data, where a table consists of some number of labeled columns of information. Our system will include a very simple query language for extracting information from these tables. For the purposes of this project, we will deal only with very small databases, and therefore will not consider speed and efficiency at all.

**Full description:** https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa14/hw/proj1.pdf

## üìùProject Abstract

![project_description](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34508318/205655270-b90103a7-7664-4879-9aa8-5bd52fde1c8e.png)

Our project mainly focuses on the `Command Interpreter` module and database structures of database system. It will basically support these functions:

- Interprete SQL language.
- Support the basic structures of database system (e.g. database files, tables, rows, columns).
- Do fundamental queries on database system, including `select`, `from`, `where`, `insert into`, `create table` clauses.

## üí≠Design Thoughts

### Database

The class that handles table instances. Specifically, the database class supports operations to store, retrieve, and delete tables. We utilize two ArrayList to store table instances and table names.

### Table

We consider `Column` to be an important attribute in the TableÔºåand it is only constructed when the database loads `.db` files or executes `create` clause (for convenience, we call these tables `database tables`, which are stored directory in heap). namely, the `Column` is constructed at the same time as the `initial table`.

> Idea: the columns of a new table obtained by the `select clause` is a subset of the `database tables`. (We define a `temporary table` is a table created by a `select clause`, otherwise `standard table`. More specifically, the temporary table is one without explicit name)

To maintain this property, the Table should support two ways of construction:

1. Table(String[] columnTitles), used for `standard table`. (The columns are initialized by string array)
2. Table(List<Column> columns), used for `temporary table`. (The table borrows columns from the table in database)

By emphasizing the importance of `Column`, the role of `_columnTitles` (type: String[]) is diminished. We'll just use them as column titles to display to the user.

### Column

To reinforce the importance of the column, the `Column` class needs to record:

1. it belongs to which table,
2. its name,
3. the full name (`tableName_columnName`Ôºâ

With item 3, we can solve the problem of attribute name dupilication.

> To supprt condition filering, we need to know where the rows in the table after cartesian product come from which table in `from clause`. We define a `super column` having the attribute of `offset`, which records the offset in the ultimate columns after cartesian product. Specifically, the `offset` attribute is derived when we do table join (cartesian product).

### Condition

We just fill out the framework provided by this project.

### Row

The simpliest unit records all data in String type. We just fill out the framework provided by this project.

## üåüHighlights

In addition to the features mentioned in the design idea, we also made optimization in these aspects:

1. `Table.toString`: print table with adaptive adjustment.
2. `Table.select(List<String> columnNames, List<Condition> conditions)`: supports column names and conditions filtering, and we increase the robustness of the function.
3. `Column(String name, Table... tables)`: If the length of tables = 1, we are constructing a database table. Otherwise, we are constructing a super column. (robustness)
4. `Colume._offset`: use offset in super columns to derive the data after cartesian product.
